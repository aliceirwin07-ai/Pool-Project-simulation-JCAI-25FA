Pool Project Simulation - Python Decal Fall 2025 Astron 98 Final Project
  This is our Final Project submission for the Astron 98 Fall 2025
  it simulates collisions of balls in a 2d plane similar to a pool table
  The white ball is controlled by the user via clicking
    the user clicks and how far away the click is from the white ball (the further the click the harder the “hit”).
  The black ball is the starting stationary ball that is influenced by the white ball’s motion
    you can see how a collison will affect the two balls
